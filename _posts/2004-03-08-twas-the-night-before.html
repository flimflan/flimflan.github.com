<P>I hope this post doesn't get aggregated anywhere.&nbsp; I know how tiring it is to read a stream of &#8220;Hey, I'm gonna try out this blogging stuff&#8221; posts.&nbsp; If it does get picked up, consider this my apology.&nbsp; Move along now.</P>
<P>I'm looking forward to my first DevDays event tomorrow.&nbsp; I plan to post my thoughts after I return (I'm not planning to lug a laptop, and stylus entry to my Axim would be painfully slow).&nbsp; Mostly, to see if I find personal value in blogging about an event.&nbsp; But also, I figure I can help contribute to Austin's chances at the <A href="http://devdaysbloggers.net">DevDaysBloggers</A> contest.</P>

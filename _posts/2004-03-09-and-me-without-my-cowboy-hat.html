<P>I arrived at DevDays Austin about 5 minutes before the scheduled start of the keynote, so I was rushing around the convention center looking for the auditorium.&nbsp; I instinctively headed in the direction of the exhibition hall that hosted&nbsp;every other Microsoft event I've attended.&nbsp; As I got closer, there was a noticeable difference in the attire of the people around me.&nbsp;&nbsp;For one, there was a&nbsp;much higher than&nbsp;average number of cowboy&nbsp;hats (as a relocated&nbsp;New Englander, I've finally gotten used to the idea that a small number of cowboy hats is to be expected). &nbsp;I finally found a woman wearing a black DevDays 2004 shirt, she immediately recognized my confusion, and directed me to the top floor on the complete opposite end of the convention center.&nbsp; Huh, why are we being &#8220;hidden away&#8221; in such a remote location?&nbsp; That's when I noticed the large banner announcing the &#8220;Texas &amp; Southwestern Cattle Rancher's Assocation&#8221; convention.&nbsp; Aha.</P>

<P>I thought the keynote for DevDays 2004 - Austin&nbsp;was a bit underwhelming.&nbsp; Jay Skelly ran through quick demos of InfoPath, BizTalk 2004, and SQL Reporting Services.&nbsp; I've seen the InfoPath demos before, and I don't think this one really demonstrated its power from a developer's point of view.&nbsp; It was more like &#8220;hey look, you can draw a form and fill in data&#8221;, which might lead someone to think &#8220;I guess its Microsoft Access for Web Services&#8221;.&nbsp; Maybe that's the intended effect, but I think it really undersells its potential.</P>
<P>The <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/biztalk/">BizTalk</A> demo was semi-interesting, as it demonstrated orchestrating a distributed transaction system through a slick GUI... but I was left thinking there must have been a lot of preparation beforehand to get the demo to the state it was in, and therefore, could not get a good feeling for what it might really be like to work with the product.</P>
<P>And I'm still not sold on <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/reporting/default.asp">SQL Reporting Services</A>.&nbsp; It looks like a replacement for Crystal Reports.&nbsp; Crystal Reports is the product that they have been bundling with Visual Studio for a few years, but has yet to gain the utilization you might expect from a bundled product.&nbsp; I was never sold on Crystal Reports, and I don't personally know anyone that was.&nbsp; So, why should I be interested in SQL Reporting Services?</P>
<P>Steven Fulcher the showed a glimpse of &#8220;<A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20040129vstudioat/manifest.xml">Whitehorse</A>&#8221;.&nbsp; Now you've got my attention!&nbsp; It looks like&nbsp;Whitehorse will finally put VS.NET in the hands of system architects, in a way that Visio was never able to.&nbsp; I'm not an expert in this field, its possible that other products, like <A href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/awdtools/developer/rosexde/">Rational's XDE</A>, may already provide this functionality, but I have never seen them presented so &#8220;approachable&#8221;.&nbsp; A co-worker was disappointed in the fact that Microsoft is creating their own graphical representation of systems and integration points, instead of using common UML symbols.&nbsp; Funny, I think that's exactly why I liked it.</P>
<P>J Sawyer ended the keynote with an overview of <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/security/productinfo/XPSP2/">XP SP2</A>.&nbsp; It was all material that has been online for a while now, but I understand not everyone follows MSDN as rabidly, and it is important to get the word out on the major changes.&nbsp; And it reminded me that I really should grab the beta soon and start testing my apps.</P>

<P>Although, I'm not really doing any Smart Client development yet, I chose to follow that track.&nbsp; Mostly because I think I've heard all of the Microsoft security sessions at least 3 times each over the last year -- OK! I'll never build SQL queries through string concatenation again!&nbsp; Actually, I shouldn't complain, it's surprising how many of my colleagues are still unaware of SQL injection vulnerabilities.&nbsp; In that sense, it is good that Microsoft continues to build awareness on these issues, I would just rather learn something new.</P>
<P>I am genuinely interested in trying my hand at Smart Client development.&nbsp; I just wonder how long it will take to be accepted in the (our) corporate environment.&nbsp; It seems just a few years ago we had to convince everyone that our Windows apps should be converted to web apps.&nbsp; Now I'd like to convince them that some of our web apps really should be &#8220;smart client&#8221; apps.&nbsp; Actually, what I'd REALLY like to convert to a smart client is all of the Visual Basic Document apps we have.&nbsp; Man, Microsoft really snowed us on that one.&nbsp; Luckily, they seemed to kill it after only one version of VB.&nbsp; Unluckily, it seems my company did a lot of new development that year, and decided to use the &#8220;latest and greatest&#8221;. Sigh.</P>

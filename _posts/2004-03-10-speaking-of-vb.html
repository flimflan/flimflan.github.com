<P>I think people can put to bed their &#8220;VB is Dead&#8221; theories.&nbsp; I didn't see a single line of C# code at DevDays 2004.&nbsp; Every session was presented in VB.NET.</P>
<P>I was a big fan of VB 3-6.&nbsp; I loved how easily I could be productive.&nbsp; I&nbsp;taught myself the .NET framework writing VB.NET code with the SDK's. &nbsp;But when my company decreed that all .NET code must be C#, I reluctantly made the transition (case-sensitivity is such a pain! I don't want to use my shift key while writing code!).&nbsp; Of course, within a month of using C#, I became a complete convert, and would never want to write VB.NET again.&nbsp; I don't miss it.&nbsp; In fact, it really turns me off from <A href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com/">projects</A> when I discover they are written in VB.NET.</P>
<P>But I have to admit, after seeing VB.NET in action again at DevDays, I started to miss it.&nbsp; Pull down menus for overrides and events!&nbsp; Auto-capitilization!&nbsp; On-the-fly compilation warnings/errors!&nbsp; I don't even want to consider the jealousy I'll feel when/if VB.NET has &#8220;edit and continue&#8221; while C# does not.</P>
<P>What's really cool about the way Microsoft is handling this:&nbsp; they aren't treating VB.NET programmers like VB programmers.&nbsp; Ok, they're obviously recognizing the fact that &#8220;the masses&#8221; feel more comfortable with VB syntax.&nbsp; But they are not going to let the masses continue to code in their old VB ways.&nbsp; This was most evident by the <A href="http://www.davidmcnamee.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=4ed42f32-b0b2-437a-94ae-fadcc7042ad0">focus on design patterns</A> in the Smart Client track sessions.&nbsp; Design patterns were traditionally the domain of OO fanatics and&nbsp;enterprise focused technologies - something you would hear about when talking to a&nbsp;J2EE programmer, not a VB programmer.&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that .NET fits into that world perfectly, I just didn't expect it to be so prominent in sessions aimed at the masses.&nbsp; I think the first session spent more time talking about the design patterns than the technology that Microsoft was showing off.&nbsp; Kudos to MS for pushing us all to be better developers, not just by giving us great tools, but by promoting&nbsp;valuable &#8220;platform agnostic&#8221; <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/practices/">best practices</A>.</P>

  content: Thanks for the reference Joshua.  I will be checking back to see how your
    skin progresses.  Looks like you have a good start.  Umm, also, my name is Mark
    not Matt.  :)  No problemo :)

  content: Thanks Mark!  I still have more ideas to polish it up, but I realized I
    was spending more time on the skin than the actual content... so, they will have
    to wait.  I'm pretty happy with it as is.

<P>My first&nbsp;custom .Text skin is largely based <A href="http://roudybob.net/archive/2004/03/14/445.aspx">on the work of RoudyBob</A>.&nbsp; I'm going to try and collect a list of resources for skinning.</P>

<P>Do they still call it that?&nbsp; It seems that &#8220;Smart&#8221; was the Microsoft word of the day for a while (smart clients, smart phones, smart devices), but I was surprised to see that I couldn't find a Smart Devices Developer Center on MSDN.&nbsp; Of course, there is, but its called <A href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/mobility/">Mobility &amp; Embedded Application Developer Center</A>. But that's not why I'm writing.</P>
<P>I'm writing because I love what they are doing with the .NET Compact Framework.&nbsp; It combines my 2 favorite platforms for hobby programming: handheld computers, and the .NET Framework.&nbsp; Before the CF, I worked with the Palm 3.0 SDK, writing C code, and manually building resource files and command-line debugging, to make simple apps for my original Palm III.&nbsp; Then I moved up to embedded Visual Tools 3.0 and was able to build full-fledged apps using the emulator.&nbsp; When I heard the vision (and played with the early releases) for the Compact Framework, I knew it was time to replace my aging Palm with a new PocketPC.</P>
<P>This past week, I've finally renewed development on a project I started a year ago.&nbsp; I've been trying to find a &#8220;killer app&#8221; for my PocketPC in the workplace (given the limitation that we are not allowed to connect to the wireless corporate network).&nbsp; Many people synch their Outlook calendar with their PDA.&nbsp; This really comes in handy on those days when you have back-to-back meetings, and don't want to return to your desk to figure out where to go next.&nbsp; The problem is, the calendar only tells you the <EM>name</EM> of the room you need to get to next.&nbsp; It doesn't tell you where that room is.&nbsp; In big, cube-filled buildings where every floor looks pretty much the same, its a challenge to memorize the location of all of the various meeting rooms.&nbsp; Fortunately, we have maps of the campus and all of the buildings on our corporate intranet.&nbsp; Unfortunately, those maps are delivered as CAD files, which render in your browser using an ActiveX plugin.&nbsp; I was hoping I could copy the CAD file to my PocketPC so that I would always have easy access to the maps.&nbsp; But the need for the ActiveX plugin killed that idea.</P>
<P>I did a little research into the file type.&nbsp; They are AutoDesk Drawing Web Files (.dwf), used to publish AutoCAD drawings on the web.&nbsp; I also found a PocketPC viewer for these files, but it costs $500.&nbsp; That's too much for this one use case.&nbsp; The real breakthrough came when I discovered the full&nbsp;file specifications and the <A href="http://concord-elex.com/whiphelp/readme/">WHIP Toolkit</A>&nbsp;which describes how to make applications that can read/write these files.&nbsp; Sounds like a project!</P>
<P>So anyway, that's the project I started a year ago, but never completed because I ran into some big hurdles: mostly, the differences between the .NET Framework (proper) and the .NET Compact Framework.&nbsp; I'll describe the problems and my solution, (and my ongoing progress) in the next few posts.</P>

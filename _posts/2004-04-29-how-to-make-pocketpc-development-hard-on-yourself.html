<P>One of my favorite &#8220;features&#8221; of the .NET Compact Framework is its compatibility with the regular .NET Framework.&nbsp; I love the idea of writing the same code to execute on multiple platforms (can you hear the snickers from the Java crowd?).</P>
<P>Deployment and debugging support for the Compact Framework are pretty impressive, but still not as easy as a desktop application.&nbsp; So when I started work on my PocketPC &#8220;Drawing Web File&#8221;&nbsp;viewer program, I started with a desktop WinForms application project.&nbsp; I figured I could create all of the file parsing and image manipulation logic in a shared library which would be referenced by the two GUI applications (one for the desktop, one for the PocketPC).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I added a Class Library project to my solution.&nbsp; Then I added a Smart Device project, and chose the Windows Application option on the <EM>second page of the wizard</EM> (this phrase is in italics, in an attempt at foreshadowing).&nbsp; I wrote some simple drawing classes in the library, then used them in both GUI apps.&nbsp; Both GUI's ran the code as expected.&nbsp; Cool!</P>
<P>So then I continued to flesh out the details of the library, using only the desktop GUI for testing and debugging.&nbsp; Once the library was at a point I was happy with, I started to work on the PocketPC GUI application.&nbsp; And that is where the nightmare began.&nbsp; Code that had just been working fine on the desktop app was now failing on the PPC app.&nbsp; It didn't make sense.&nbsp; I could compile the PPC app and the library with no errors.&nbsp; But then during runtime, I would get &#8220;method not found&#8221; type exceptions.&nbsp; Apparently I was calling methods (or more often, method overloads) that did not exist in the Compact Framework.&nbsp; This was completely foreign to me, since I was accustomed to the strongly typed .NET environment always finding those kinds of problems at compile time.&nbsp; </P>
<P>I finally realized that the class library project had references to the System.* assemblies in the .NET Framework installation folder, while the Smart Client Windows Application project had references to the System.* assemblies in the Compact Framework installation folder.&nbsp; So I then manually removed the standard references from the class library, and added them back, using the files in the Compact Framework folder.&nbsp; That seemed to improve the situation a bit - I started to get compile time errors in the Smart Client project, which helped me identify the incompatible code, but things still didn't seem to work as expected.</P>
<P>After a little bit of googling, I discovered the key: when developing a shared class library, you must use the Smart Device Class Library project template NOT the &#8220;normal&#8221; Class Library template.&nbsp; The Smart Device project type is &#8220;retargetble&#8221; (or something along those lines), which means it&nbsp;automatically associates&nbsp;with the&nbsp;correct shared assemblies based on the target platform: PocketPC or desktop.&nbsp; But wait, on initial inspection, there IS no Smart Device Class Library project template!&nbsp; There is just &#8220;Smart Device Application&#8221;.&nbsp; But... what was that about a <EM>second page of a wizard</EM>?&nbsp; Ah.&nbsp; You need to choose Smart Device Application, which then launches a <EM>second page</EM>, which allows you to choose between &#8220;Windows Application&#8221; or &#8220;Class Library&#8221;.&nbsp; After rebuilding my shared library project using the Smart Device Class Library template, all my mysterious problems went away.&nbsp; I now had full intellisense which told me exactly which methods and overloads were available on the Compact Framework.</P>
<P>So, to make a completely unnecessarily long story short:&nbsp; when building a&nbsp;Compact Framework application that is going to share code with a .NET Framework (proper) application, make sure to use the Smart Device Class Library project type.</P>

<P>I recently read&nbsp;<A href="http://www.codingslave.com">Coding Slave</A> by Bob Reselman, after having my interest piqued by <A href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/5700.aspx">Rory</A>.&nbsp; This is a book that every software developer should read.&nbsp; It is a very easy read, but its message has the potential to be very important to our lives.&nbsp; It has already had a positive effect on how I approach and feel about my day-to-day job.&nbsp; Initially, the subject matter may seem depressing, but I think the ultimate message is really uplifting.&nbsp; After you read the book (or if you aren't conviced to read it yet), go listen to the <A href="http://www.franklins.net/dotnetrocks/">.NET Rocks</A> episode with Bob Reselman.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;go read <A href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/6088.aspx">Rory's interview with the author</A> (it has a link to the first part).&nbsp; At that point, you will probably want to read the book again.</P>
<P>Bob isn't the only coder to write a book about the life of coder.&nbsp; You should also read Ellen Ullman's <A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0872863328">Close to the Machine: Technophilia and its Discontents</A>.&nbsp; This is the first book that I read which&nbsp;confirmed my theory that coding is a personality trait, not a chosen career path.</P>

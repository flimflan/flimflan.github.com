<P>Wow.&nbsp; Now <A href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/05/12.html#a7436">this</A> freaked me out.</P>
<P>You see, I got so much out of last year's TechEd, that I couldn't wait to get back.&nbsp; I've been checking the site regularly for the opening of this year's registration.&nbsp; Before registration was available, I was already working my management looking for the necessary approvals.&nbsp; I got the sign off and was all set to go.&nbsp; But when registration opened up, I got word that I might be able to use one of the complimentary passes provided to my company as a sponsor.&nbsp; Being a good corporate citizen, trying to save some bucks, I contacted the people that were allocating the passes MONTHS ago.&nbsp; I made my plane/hotel reservations. &nbsp;They told me &#8220;sure, we might be able to give you one, call back in a month or so&#8221;.&nbsp; So I did.&nbsp; &#8220;We don't know yet, call back in a couple weeks&#8221;.&nbsp; So I did.&nbsp; &#8220;Try again next week, we should know by then.&#8221;&nbsp; So I did.&nbsp; &#8220;We're working on it, we'll let you know.&nbsp; Don't worry about it, they won't sell out, you can always buy the ticket if you don't get one of ours.&#8221;&nbsp; Okay, fine, but I'm still anxious.&nbsp; Finally, Friday I sent an email asking for a final answer, I really need to finalize my plans.&nbsp; Monday I received a reply &#8220;sorry, all of the passes have been allocated&#8221;.&nbsp; AAAAHH!&nbsp; So I quickly log onto the site and buy my full pass.&nbsp; </P>
<P>And now I find out that 2 days later they sold out!&nbsp; What's the big deal, the story has a happy ending, right?&nbsp; Well, yeah, but it's strange when my paranoid, anxious, worry-wart personality ends up working to my benefit.&nbsp; If I hadn't kept bugging for an answer, I would have missed out - despite having the approval for the funds.&nbsp; Ouch.&nbsp; So, thank you, paranoid brain.</P>
<P>By the way, does this happen often?&nbsp; Does TechEd ever sell out?&nbsp; I've only been to 2 others (2000, 2003), but I don't remember hearing of them selling out.&nbsp; Does this mean all of the sessions are going to be really crowded?</P>

<P>Up until about a week ago, I didn't think much of the TabletPC.&nbsp; I had never used one, and I assumed it was mostly just an enlarged PocketPC, with all of the user input difficulties that go along with not having a keyboard.&nbsp; Then I had a chance to view the <A href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=7603#7603">Channel9 video</A> that&nbsp;<A href="http://scoble.weblogs.com/">Scoble</A> was hyping.&nbsp; The context-based recognition blew me away.&nbsp; This thing is for real.</P>
<P>If you aren't sold yet, go watch the video.&nbsp; And if you are at TechEd - go do the TabletPC Hands On Lab in 6F.&nbsp; Unlike in most retail stores, they have actual TabletPCs (with the stylus!) that you can use.&nbsp; The lab walks you through using the TabletPC, as well as developing applications using the TabletPC SDK and VS.NET, and creating your own context definitions for &#8220;non ink aware&#8221; applications.&nbsp; It takes about 45 minutes to go through all the labs, but it is worth it.&nbsp; You really get a feel for what the platform is all about.&nbsp; As a bonus, when you complete the lab, you get a 32MB USB drive (make sure to get a stamp at the lab, then bring it to the Microsoft Pavillion in the Exhibit Hall to get your drive).&nbsp; The only drawback is that you are left REALLY wanting to buy a new TabletPC.</P>

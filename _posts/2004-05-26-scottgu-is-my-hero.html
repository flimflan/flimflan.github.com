Seriously, that guy is the best.&nbsp; <a href="http://flimflan.com/blog/TheDevDaysDVD.aspx">I've said it before</a>, and I'll say it again: if you ever have a chance to see <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/">Scott Guthrie</a>
talk, do it.&nbsp; He has all of the qualities of a great tech
presenter: he knows his stuff inside and out, he presents through code
- not slides, and <strong><u>he will answer all of your questions</u></strong>.&nbsp;
I bolded and underlined that last statement for a reason (I probably
should have increased the font and set it to all caps too).&nbsp; I
don't simply mean his presentations cover all the material you'd ever
want to know (though they come close).&nbsp; He stated explicitly in
the beginning of the talk (paraphrasing) “If you have any questions,
come talk to me when I'm done, I will stick around and answer
questions, as long as it takes”.&nbsp; And he means it.&nbsp; That is
exactly why I loved TechEd last year, and was so eager to get back this
year.&nbsp; Scott makes TechEd.&nbsp; He just held court on ASP.NET 2.0
for over 4 hours!&nbsp; Starting at 3:45pm, he gave back to back
sessions (DEV313/DEV314) that were really just 2 parts of 1 session,
with an intermission.&nbsp; He then took questions at the front of the
room for about 15 minutes, before getting kicked out because someone
else had to use the room.&nbsp; Instead of calling it a night (it is
7pm at this point), he invited everyone to walk with him to the cabana
area where he continued to answer questions until after 8pm.

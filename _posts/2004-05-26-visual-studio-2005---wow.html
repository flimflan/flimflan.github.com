If you use Visual Studio.NET and are at TechEd - go see Cyrus (didn't catch his last name) in the Microsoft pavillion of the exhibit hall.&nbsp; He works on the compiler/IDE team at Microsoft and gives a great demonstration of the new features coming in VS2005.&nbsp; I had read about the new features, and played around with the pre-release versions a little, so I was already anxious to get my hands on it.&nbsp; But after watching Cyrus's demo, I can't wait.&nbsp; The &#8220;code definition&#8221; window is ingenious.&nbsp; When you place your cursor on a variable in your code editor, the code definition window displays the source code where the variable is declared.&nbsp; Not just the definition of the type that you might get in a tooltip, but the actual lines of code (a few before and after) so you get the context of the declaration, as well as any comments, etc.&nbsp; One of my most used keyboard shortcuts&nbsp;is &#8220;Go to definition&#8221;.&nbsp; With this new feature, it will be completely unnecessary.

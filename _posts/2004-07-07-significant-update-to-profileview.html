<P>As <A href="/IntroducingProfileViewForASPNET20.html">promised</A>, with the recent release of Visual Studio 2005 Beta 1, I have created an updated version of the ProfileView control.&nbsp; The most noticeable new features:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Much better WYSIWYG experience, as the control now renders your profile at design time. (Eternal thanks to <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/mszCool/archive/2004/06/30/169793.aspx">this post</A> on accessing web.config at design-time - I searched high and low for this information and came up empty - the newsgroups are littered with unanswered questions on this.&nbsp; I guess I got lucky that someone at TechEd Europe decided to talk about it. <FONT color=#ff0000><STRONG>UPDATE</STRONG></FONT>: I've found an even better solution for <A href="/AccessingWebconfigAtDesignTimeInNET20.html">accessing web.config at design-time</A>.) 
<LI>A new read-only mode that allows users to view their profile without being able to edit it. 
<LI>FREE SOURCE CODE</LI></UL>
<P>I've also created a new home for the ProfileView files.&nbsp; Instead of creating links to different versions in each blog post, each of my blog entries will now reference <A href="/ProfileView.html">this article</A>.&nbsp; I will keep the article updated with all of the latest ProfileView happenings.</P>
<P>Go get <A href="/ProfileView.html">FlimFlan.WebControls.ProfileView</A> and tell me what you think.</P>

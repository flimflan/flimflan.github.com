<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">I’m taking a 2-post break (this is 1 of 2) from software&nbsp;to talk about my Honda Prelude/Dell DJ project.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">I have long been searching for a way to bring my entire music collection with me, wherever I go.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I have all of my CDs ripped to my hard drive.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>While at work, I listen to the full collection in shuffle mode, effectively creating the perfect radio station.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I’ve always wanted to replicate that experience in the car, but was hesitant to shell out the bucks for a <A href="http://www.phatnoise.com/">PhatBox</A> (the ideal solution, in my opinion).</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">I recently picked up a <A href="http://search.dell.com/results.aspx?s=dhs&cat=snp&c=us&l=en&cs=19&category_id=2999&k=dell+dj+20">Dell DJ 20GB</A>, with hopes that it would help solve my problem.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I was able transfer my collection to the DJ with room to spare (20GB is a <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /><st1:place w:st="on">LOT</st1:place> of room).<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>However, it still wasn’t clear how I would listen to the DJ in my car.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I did some research on the various FM transmitters available, but it seemed like a lot of people were unhappy with them.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It also sounded like a hassle and mess to have all those wire around.</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">I wanted a “built-in” solution, much like the <A href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/bmw/">BMW-iPod</A> setup, without having to shell out the bucks for a BMW or iPod.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I decided I would buy a new car stereo that included an AUX input.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Some models included a front-panel AUX input, which would allow me to attach the DJ using a male-male 1/8” cord, but I ruled that out because I didn’t want the “clutter”.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Most models included a rear AUX input in the form of RCA jacks, which would require a 1/8” to RCA cord to attach the DJ.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I bought a rear AUX model from Crutchfield and the cord from Radio Shack.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Unfortunately, the receiver wasn’t compatible with my car speakers (the Prelude has a non-standard “<A href="http://personal.bellsouth.net/v/i/vidgamer/preludeaudio.html">Acoustic Feedback System</A>”) – a fact that Crutchfield tech support failed to tell me until AFTER I had ordered and spent hours doing the install. (Note, the speakers can be made to work, but it would involve cutting wires, etc.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>One of my goals in this project is to avoid making any permanent changes to the car.).</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;</P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Knowing that a new receiver was now out of the question, along with the fact that I was now comfortable opening up my dash, I turned to an FM modulator solution.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Check out part 2 for all of the details.</P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">As mentioned in previous post, I decided to use a Dell DJ with an FM modulator to play digital music files through the car’s speakers.</P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Steps:</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<DIV class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Disconnect the negative terminal of the car battery.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Remove the factory stereo.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The frame that holds the stereo also holds a “tray” below the stereo.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I think the tray is a place-holder for additional factory accessories.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It seemed like the perfect location to mount my DJ controls.</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">As luck would have it, the “Windows Services for Unix” DVD case that was handed out at TechEd is the exact width of the space previously occupied by the tray.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I would use this as the “panel” for my controls.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I measured out the appropriate height needed to cover the space and cut down the DVD case.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I made sure to leave the “spine” of the DVD case on one end.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This would prove useful, as it would allow me to mount the panel recessed into the stereo frame.</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">I cut out a square hole in the panel just big enough so the inline remote buttons would show through.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>On the opposite end of the panel, I poked a hole through to mount the on/off switch that comes with the FM Modulator.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>(When the modulator is ON, the signal is cut off from your car antennae, reducing the interference).</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">The panel was pretty flimsy (remember, it was cut from a free DVD case), so I decided to use a block of Styrofoam for reinforcement.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I cut the block to be slightly smaller (width and height) than the panel.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I then carved out a “mold” of the inline remote and its two wires (IN and OUT) into the block.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I also created a hole through the depth of the block so that the wires from the remote could come out the other side.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>When the carving was done, I was able to set the remote in the Styrofoam block so that it was flush with the block’s surface,<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>and run it’s wires through to the back.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I then used the mounting tape to attach the black panel to the Styrofoam block, so the inline remote was sandwiched between them.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>From the front of the panel, you could only see the remote’s buttons.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>From the other side came the remote’s wires.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The on/off switch for the modulator was screwed into the panel right next to the Styrofoam block (it is not IN the block like the remote).</DIV>
<LI>
<DIV class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">The rest was easy.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I mounted the FM Modulator to the inner wall of the console, right next to the “cigarette lighter” accessory plug, using the hook-and-loop fastener tape.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I connected the power line for the modulator to the power line of the accessory plug (no splicing, I was able to jam the modulator power wire in with the accessory plug’s wire).<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>To ground the modulator, I found a screw being used to ground something else.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The car antennae plugged into the modulator, the modulator plugged into the car stereo’s antennae plug, and the DJ inline remote plugged into the modulator (using the 1/8” to RCA cable).<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I routed the other end of the inline remote into the glove box, where the DJ will reside.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>As luck would have it, there is enough slack in the remote wire to allow me to pull the DJ out of the glove box while it is still attached.</DIV></LI></OL>

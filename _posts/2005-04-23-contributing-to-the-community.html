<p>This blog is not dormant. Or maybe it is, but this blog owner is
not. I am generally really picky about what I consider worthy of a
post. I try to avoid "me too" posts, or adding my take on something I'm
not really qualified to comment on, or personal just about me posts
(though I guess this one is dangerously close to that). My philosophy
is, if someone searching for some information can find it easily
elsewhere on the web, from a more authoritive voice, then there is no
need for me to post. I do not have a delusion that I have a readership
that relies on me solely for their information, and if I don't post
about it, they won't find out about it. However, when I solve a problem
that wasn't as easy as I thought it would be, because the information
wasn't as available as I thought it should be, <a href="http://flimflan.com/blog/PermissionsOnTheWindows2003ServerEventLog.aspx">I will post</a>.</p>
<p>I have found that I can contribute more to the community by being
active in the newsgroups. You can find real people, with real problems,
with real needs. If I can post a little bit of information, even if I
am not the authority for that information, I know that I am helping
someone. That's very different than just repeating some general
information on my blog with the assumption that someone is looking to
me for an answer.</p>
<p>On a related note, I got caught responding to a Usenet troll for the
first time. I feel silly, dirty, naive. I'm used to having my guard up
when reading troll havens like Slashdot, but this one caught me off
guard because the posts in the groups I've been following are usually
helpful, on-topic information. I thought I was providing useful
information, but in fact I was just fueling a fire the troll was trying
to start. So, just like I want to avoid adding "noise" on my blog, I'll
have to be more careful in the future about contributing "noise" to the
newsgroups.</p>

<P>I'd like to try and integrate my newsgroup posts with my blog.&nbsp; I mentioned earlier that I spend more time in the newsgroups than I do posting to the blog.&nbsp; But I do like the presentation and accessibility of the blog, so I'm wondering how I can combine them.</P>
<P>My first thought was to use the Google Web API to pull my newsgroup posts and integrate them into the blog's existing RSS feed.&nbsp; But it looks like the Google Web API does not work with Google Groups (yet?).</P>
<P>For now, I can just publish this link to&nbsp;<A href="http://groups-beta.google.com/groups?q=&amp;start=0&amp;scoring=d&amp;enc_author=GU6hzA8AAABVTMQnyPBV5qy-P3t8tLLf&amp;">newsgroup posts by Joshua Flanagan</A>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe I'll make it part of my blog skin so it is always available.&nbsp; Anyone have any better ideas?</P>
<P>I'm not really sure yet how useful this would be to the general public.&nbsp; The person with the specific problem already read the answer in the newsgroups.&nbsp; It may turn out to just be one of those things that makes it easier for the me to find my own information.</P>

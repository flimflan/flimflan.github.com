<P>If you are at TechEd 2005, and&nbsp;are at all interested in the TabletPC and/or TabletPC development, do yourself a favor and go do the TabletPC Hands on Labs at TechED.&nbsp; It will be worth your while, trust me.&nbsp; Not only will you learn all the cool things you can do with the Tablet as a developer, you will also get the coolest (and most valuable, in $$)&nbsp;piece of SWAG available at the conference.&nbsp; I was blown away by the lab content, and then blown away again when I received my parting gift.&nbsp; Forget t-shirts and glowing yo-yos; this is actually useful.&nbsp; The TabletPC team has a new fanboy.</P>
<P><STRONG>Update</STRONG>: The gift was a <A href="http://www.wacom.com/graphire/index.cfm">Wacom Graphire 3</A> digitizer tablet.&nbsp; I didn't want to spoil the surprise during TechEd, because it seemed like the TabletPC team was trying to keep it a secret (I imagine they didn't have enough for everybody).</P>

I finally grew tired of all the comment spam I was getting on my .TEXT blog.&nbsp; I had already modified one of the stored procedures so that it wouldn't save any comments on old posts, but I would still get the email notification for the comment.&nbsp; That was annoying.<BR>I can't figure out what is going on with Community Server - it seems like it is too much for what I need.&nbsp; And I couldn't tell if they have implemented any comment spam prevention, aside from moderation.<BR>Scott Hanselman has been posting about dasBlog a lot recently, and I've seen their CAPTCHA solution in action, so I figured I'd give that a try.<BR>I think I have migrated all of my old content (thanks to <A href="http://iceglue.com/tranqy/CategoryView,category,DotText2DasBlog.aspx">DotTextToDasBlog</A>), but it will be a while before I get around to re-implementing my custom skin.<BR>

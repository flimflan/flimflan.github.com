<P>I have a laptop at work that is well past its depreciation lifespan, and by the sound of the wheezing fans, I don't think it will last much longer.&nbsp; It is still running Windows 2000 Pro, without the latest patches, so that I can do builds for a very fragile application I support.&nbsp; I cannot keep it powered on very long, for fear&nbsp;1) the hardware may finally fail or 2) the network security police will kick it off the domain.&nbsp; Luckily I have a brand new desktop with plenty of hard disk space, memory, and processing power to play the role of TWO computers using Microsoft Virtual PC.&nbsp; I wasn't sure if it would be possible to migrate an existing PC's configuration to a Virtual PC, but it is, and I am very happy with the results.</P>
<P>My initial plan was to use the <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/virtualserver/evaluation/vsmt.mspx">Microsoft Virtual Server Migration Toolkit</A> (I also run Virtual Server - the images are interchangeable with Virtual PC).&nbsp; However, I was quickly discouraged when I started reading the requirements (a separate server running Windows 2003 Automated Deployment Services).&nbsp; It seems their target market is enterprises converting a lot of legacy servers to Virtual Server&nbsp;-- not single users&nbsp;preserving an old PC.</P>
<P>I learned of a much better way while listening to <A href="http://www.mcwtech.com/CS/blogs/brianr/">Brian Randell</A>'s <A href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showID=115">appearance</A> on .<A href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/">NET Rocks!</A>&nbsp;(if you don't want to listen, the Sep/Oct 2005 issue of <A href="http://www.code-magazine.com/">Code Magazine</A> has a partial transcript of the show that includes the relevant info).&nbsp;He seemed to hint that he was writing a book about Virtual PC/Server, and the book would probably mention this procedure, and it would be available online, but I was unable to find it, so I'll document it myself.&nbsp; Brian deserves all the credit for the process; I'm just filling in the details for my specific case.</P>
<P><EM>I'll refer to the PC to be virtualized (my creaking laptop) as the "legacy PC",&nbsp;the new desktop that runs Virtual Server as the "host PC", and the system running under Virtual Server as "virtual PC".</EM></P>
<P>1) Save an image of the legacy PC in its current state using your favorite disk/partition imaging software (I used <A href="http://www.symantec.com/sabu/ghost/">Norton Ghost 8.2</A> because it was available to me at work; if I had to do it on my own dime, I might have tried <A href="http://www.partimage.org/">PartImage</A> with <A href="http://www.sysresccd.org/">SystemRescueCD</A>).</P>
<P>This was the first challenge.&nbsp; You cannot run Ghost in Windows running on the partition you want to make into an image.&nbsp; You also can't store the image file you are creating&nbsp;on the disk you are backing up (for reasons that should be obvious),and I only had a single hard drive in the legacy PC.&nbsp; I figured I would have to boot from a DOS floppy disk, and then connect to a network share where I could store the image.&nbsp; I thought this would be much harder, until I discovered <A href="http://www.nu2.nu/bootdisk/network/">Bart's Network Boot Disk</A>.&nbsp; It was easy as: </P>
<OL>
<LI>create the network boot disk floppy on the host PC</LI>
<LI>share the folder containing the Ghost software on the host PC</LI>
<LI>share another folder on the host PC that will store the legacy PC's image</LI>
<LI>reboot the legacy PC into DOS using the network boot floppy disk (my NIC and network settings were all detected automatically)</LI>
<LI>map a drive (G:) to the ghost software share on the host PC</LI>
<LI>map a drive (I:) to the image share</LI>
<LI>run the DOS version fo Ghost from G, select the disk/partition to backup, and save the image to I:</LI></OL>
<P>2) Prepare the legacy PC for distribution.&nbsp;Brian said to "sysprep" the PC so that it will detect hardware on the next boot; a verb that was new to me.&nbsp; With a quick search, I learned he was referring to the <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/downloads/tools/sysprep/default.asp">Windows System Preparation Tool</A>&nbsp;(there are different versions of the tool for each OS).&nbsp; There seemed to be a lot of documentation for sysprep, and a whole lot of options that can be configured through an .inf file.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was impatient.&nbsp; I downloaded the tool to my legacy PC, extracted it, and double-clicked sysprep.exe without any customization.&nbsp; I accepted the warning that my OS would lose some key configuration (which is why we made the backup image in step 1) and proceeded.&nbsp; It automatically shuts down the PC when it is complete.&nbsp; DO NOT start the PC into Windows at this point or you will have to start over!</P>
<P>3) Save an image of the legacy PC in its new "sysprepped" state, using the same process used in step 1.</P>
<P>4) Create a new Virtual PC/Server on the host PC.&nbsp; I was able to give it the same amount of RAM and same size hard drive as the legacy PC, but I don't think this is required (of course the virtual hard drive has to be at least big enough to hold the image data).&nbsp; Make sure to setup the network card on the Virtual PC.</P>
<P>5) Import the legacy PC image to the virtual PC.&nbsp; </P>
<OL>
<LI>put the network boot floppy in the disk drive of the host PC</LI>
<LI>configure the virual PC so that it captures the physical floppy disk drive</LI>
<LI>turn on the virtual PC - it should boot into DOS from the network boot disk</LI>
<LI>map the same drives (G: and I:)</LI>
<LI>run Ghost and restore the sysprepped image created in step 3 to the virtual PC's hard drive</LI></OL>
<P>6) Complete the Windows install.&nbsp; After the image is copied to the virtual PC, reboot the virtual PC and you should see the Windows startup screen.&nbsp; In my case it hung for a very long time on the Windows 2000 graphical boot screen, to the point that I suspected it had failed.&nbsp; But this is the expected behavior.&nbsp; Windows is going through its whole installation routine where it has to&nbsp;take inventory of all of the hardware on the new system.&nbsp; I eventually saw new "setup" screens that re-assured me that the system was behaving correctly.&nbsp; I was then surprised when I was prompted to enter my 25-digit product key.&nbsp; Since all of our PCs are built using corporate images, and I don't have access to the Volume License edition we use internally, I had no idea how I would find out my product key.&nbsp; I tried the MSDN product key without success.&nbsp; What to do?&nbsp; The process takes a slight detour (I don't think Brian mentioned this part):</P>
<OL>
<LI>Restore the ORIGINAL backup image of the legacy PC to the legacy PC (using the same network boot disk + Ghost process).</LI>
<LI>Boot into Windows on the legacy PC (it should not be back to the state before anything was changed)</LI>
<LI>Download and run <A href="http://www.magicaljellybean.com/keyfinder.shtml">keyfinder.exe from Magical Jelly Bean Software</A></LI>
<LI>Enter the product key from the legacy PC on the waiting virtual PC</LI></OL>
<P>The rest of the Windows installation was pretty straightforward.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was able to join the domain (using a new hostname for the virtual pc) and everything came back up exactly as it was on the legacy PC.&nbsp; All applications, all user profiles (including domain accounts) and preferences, everything.&nbsp; There is really no difference between the new virtual PC and the old, legacy PC running on failing physical hardware.&nbsp; I took one additional step as a precaution:&nbsp; shutdown Windows and turn off the virtual PC, and then&nbsp;copy the virtual hard drive (.vhd) file to a backup location on another server.&nbsp; Since this legacy PC's functionality is so important, I didn't want to risk losing it to a hard drive failure on my host PC.</P>
<P>Keep in mind that none of this is supported or recommended by Microsoft.&nbsp; They offer the VSMT for servers, and that's it.&nbsp; Make sure you understand all of the licensing issues around Virtual PC, sysprep, etc.&nbsp; I have no idea how well this would work with Windows XP (or 2003)&nbsp;and its activation process (which would notice the drastic change in hardware when you migrate the OS).</P>

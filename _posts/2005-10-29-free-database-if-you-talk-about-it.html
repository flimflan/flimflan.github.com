<a href="http://www.vistadb.net/BlogOffer.asp">VistaDB</a> is offering a free license to bloggers that give them a mention. You don't even have to endorse it. I'm intrigued enough to give it a try, thinking it might be a nice solution for use with cheap/free ASP.NET hosts that don't give you SQL Server space. Works with .NET 1.1/2.0 (and non-managed stuff too).<br>

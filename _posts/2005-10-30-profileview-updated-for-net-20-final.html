<P>I've updated my <A href="/ProfileView.html">ProfileView ASP.NET 2.0 web control</A> for the final release of .NET 2.0. No new features with this time around, but I hope to polish it up in the near future.</P>
<P>It complements the new ASP.NET Login controls to <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/10/18/427754.aspx">build personalized websites with very little code</A>.</P>

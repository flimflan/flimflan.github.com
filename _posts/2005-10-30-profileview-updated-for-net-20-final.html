    I''m curious how to use your .dll. Referencing to it seems like being the wrong
    way. How to include it in VS2005 RTM?


    Thanks a lot!'

  content: ! 'In VS2005, right-click on your project and choose Add Reference... and
    choose the DLL.

    Check your toolbox - if it does not have a FlimFlan.WebControls sections, you
    will need to manually add it. Right-click on the toolbox and select Choose Items...,
    click the Browse... button and find the DLL.  Press OK to close, and you should
    now have a ProfileView control in your toolbox, which you can then drag onto a
    WebForms page.'

<P>I've updated my <A href="/ProfileView.html">ProfileView ASP.NET 2.0 web control</A> for the final release of .NET 2.0. No new features with this time around, but I hope to polish it up in the near future.</P>
<P>It complements the new ASP.NET Login controls to <A href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/10/18/427754.aspx">build personalized websites with very little code</A>.</P>

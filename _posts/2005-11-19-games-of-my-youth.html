  content: ! 'it certainly brings...I loved my C64, althought in my country the games
    were hard to get so you had to have many ''piracy'' links spread to make archive
    =)


    last ninja, creatures, the great giana sisters, ultima3/4, great escape, ye ar
    kung fu and many many awesome text based like ''ten little indians'' or my favorite
    ''erik the viking''


    althought I didn''t got my hands on wasteland and bards tale(just knowed about
    BT on PC) I think the best games ever written was on c64, because of imagination(and
    small age:-) and my year! struggle playing Sid''s Mayer Pirates!


    aaaaaaa a tear drop for C64'

  content: ! "I just got rid of all my old C-64 stuff when I moved from my old house
    and really regret it.  I left it all in boxes in the attic my wife was always
    complaining about my junk collection and I had to shed some weight but couldn't
    bring myself to throw it away.  \n\nI spent so many hours with my c-64s and actually
    used it right up through my sophomore year in college.  What a sweet little machine.\n\nPS.
    \ Thanks for the profile.aspx sample.  I'm rewriting my site and it's going to
    save me a lot of time."

<P>My dad is selling the family house, so I just received a bunch of boxes with a bunch of old stuff I hadn't seen in years. One box contained all my old Commodore 64 5.25" disks (unfortunately, the C64 was nowhere to be found). Looking at these disks brought back a lot of memories of a LOT of hours spent playing them. <BR><IMG src="/assets/post_images/commodore_games.jpg" border=0> <BR>

<LI><A href="http://www.the-underdogs.org/game.php?id=1107">SuperStar Ice Hockey</A> (way ahead of its time, included multi-season franchise mode, with player trades, drafts, training, etc)</LI>
<LI><A href="http://mule.eichberger.net/about.php">M.U.L.E.</A> </LI>
<LI>QuantumLink - <A href="http://www.quantum-link.org/">recently revived, kinda</A></LI>
<LI><A href="http://www.commodore.ca/history/company/turks_geos.htm">GEOS</A> - made my C64 as slick as my friend's new Macintosh - except that mine had color!</LI>
<LI><A href="http://infocom.elsewhere.org/gallery/zork3/zork3.html">Zork III</A> - these used to be available free online, but I think Activision has pulled them, with an eye towards making some bucks off nostalgic geeks.</LI>
<LI>Bard's Tale III&nbsp;-&nbsp;one of the great&nbsp;RPGs, before RPG was watered down to mean "a game that allows you to level-up your character". Not to be confused with the recent PS2/XBOX game that soiled a once good name.</LI>
<LI><A href="http://www.classicgaming.com/rotw/wasteland.shtml">Wasteland</A> - the coolest RPG of the day (yeah, Bard's Tale gets points for being first, but Wasteland had <EM>style</EM>). It was later "unofficially" revived as <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(game)">Fallout 2</A>, which did an admirable job or recreating the fun of the original series.</LI>
<LI>Dragon Wars - an unofficial successor to the Bard's Tale series - it never held my attention the way BT3 and Wasteland did.</LI></UL>
<P>Now I need to get one of those parallel cables to hook up a 1541 drive and copy these disk images to <A href="http://www.viceteam.org/">VICE</A>.</P>

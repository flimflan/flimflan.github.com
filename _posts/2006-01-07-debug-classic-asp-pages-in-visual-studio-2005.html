<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mikhailarkhipov/">Mikhail Arkhipov</a> already posted exactly what you need to know to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mikhailarkhipov/archive/2005/06/24/432308.aspx">debug classic asp pages in Visual Studio 2005</a>. His post includes the instructions for Win2K3, but the comments include instructions for WinXP.<br /><br /><font size="1">I'm only posting this in hopes that it helps the search engines lead people to his post. When I searched for &quot;debug classic asp visual studio 2005&quot;, I had no luck. If I would have abbreviated visual studio as vs (as he did in his post title), I would have found it immediately.</font>

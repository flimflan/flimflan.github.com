I've posted the source and binary for the latest release of my <a href="/ProfileView.html">ProfileView ASP.NET server control</a>. I was finally able to address the much requested fix to make the order of the properties displayed at runtime reflect the order they are declared in the web.config. Here are the release notes:<br><ul><li>Properties now display in the order they are listed in web.config<br>
  </li><li>Design-time view now uses same rendering method as runtime</li><li>Fixed design-time bug that caused it to fail when a profile property type was not specified</li><li>Design-time view now has a Smart Tag to allow you to preview an anonymous user's profile<br>
  </li></ul>

  content: ! 'Hi,


    I tried to use your ProfileView webcontrol, but I don''t know how (no tut, no
    sample...)

    Here is what I did :


    &amp;gt;%@ Register TagPrefix=&quot;FlimFlan&quot; Namespace=&quot;FlimFlan.WebControls&quot;
    Assembly=&quot;ProfileView&quot; %&amp;lt;


    &amp;gt;form id=&quot;profile01&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot;%lt;

    &amp;gt;FlimFlan:ProfileView id=&quot;ProfileView01&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot;
    /%lt;

    &amp;gt;/form%lt;



    but it doesn''t work... can you give some hint please.'

  content: ! 'Close. In your Register directive, you need to set the &quot;Assembly&quot;
    attribute to the name of the assembly (the DLL, without extension) - not the name
    of the control. You specify the name of the control when you actually place the
    control.  Example:


    [%@ Register Assembly=&quot;FlimFlan.WebControls&quot; Namespace=&quot;FlimFlan.WebControls&quot;
    TagPrefix=&quot;flim&quot; %]


    [flim:profileview id=&quot;ProfileView1&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot;/]


    (using square brackets instead of angle brackets)'

  content: ! 'Hi Joshua


    I''m trying to use your control and have one question regarding it. I''ve three
    atrributes defined for my profile in the web.config, namely FirstName, LastName
    and PhoneNumber. The control is showing textboxes for First Name and Last Name,
    but nothing for Phone Number. Is there any way I can have it show additional controls
    for modifying additional profile information???


    Regards

    Nik'

  content: ! 'Regarding my earlier question, I had phone number as type int in the
    web.config, as soon as I changed it to string, it appeared in the ProfileView
    control.


    so my next question is how can I''ve a Validator validate one of the textboxes,
    if it''s possible to do so. Also, I would like to format the styling of the ProfileView
    control. Can it be done??


    Regards

    nik


    P.S - I just tried to peep inside ur source code. It''s all VOODOO magic to me'

  content: ! 'Try setting the type of phone-number to &quot;Int32&quot; or &quot;System.Int32&quot;
    instead of &quot;int&quot;. The control does not recognize &quot;int&quot; as
    a valid type, since it is not defined by the .NET Framework (it is defined as
    an alias inside the C# compiler).

    The styling options are not as good as I would like. The control should render
    IDs and CSS class names on each of the tags. You should be able to add styles
    to each control by referencing those names and IDs in a stylesheet.'

  content: ! 'Some issues here:


    1. When UserName property is set it does not re-render the control to update the
    profile values of that user. In fact it gets confused and makes a mess of it.


    2. How would it go about re-rendering the whole control when the profile properties
    of the user (not just the values but the profile set) differs from the previous
    one?


    I placed it in a page where I first select the application which then loads the
    users which is then used to set the username on the ProfileView. It just does
    not work. You can set the Username property but that is about it.'

  content: The UserName property was added as an afterthought, and it is now obvious
    it was not implemented correctly. The code needs to be changed so that the controls
    are re-built in the PreRender event, so that the updated state of internal values
    are reflected. I have not had any time to dedicated to this fix. The source code
    is available, so you are welcome to make the change, and I will repost it and
    give you credit.

I've posted the source and binary for the latest release of my <a href="/ProfileView.html">ProfileView ASP.NET server control</a>. I was finally able to address the much requested fix to make the order of the properties displayed at runtime reflect the order they are declared in the web.config. Here are the release notes:<br><ul><li>Properties now display in the order they are listed in web.config<br>
  </li><li>Design-time view now uses same rendering method as runtime</li><li>Fixed design-time bug that caused it to fail when a profile property type was not specified</li><li>Design-time view now has a Smart Tag to allow you to preview an anonymous user's profile<br>
  </li></ul>

I'm still using the Subversion command line interface (despite <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DasBlogMovedFromCVSToSVN.aspx">Scott's gentle recommendation</a> that maybe I should graduate to the GUI world), but I've grown out of WinDiff and moved on to <a href="http://winmerge.sourceforge.net/">WinMerge</a> as my visual diff tool of choice. The process for integrating the tools is the same that I outlined for <a href="/UsingWinDiffWithSubVersion.html">using WinDiff</a>, except the contents of the batch file should be changed to:<br />
<p><span style="color: Black; background-color: transparent; font-family: Courier New; font-size: 11px;">start <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); background-color: rgb(228, 228, 228); font-family: Courier New; font-size: 11px;">&quot;WinMerge&quot;</span> /B /WAIT <span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); background-color: rgb(228, 228, 228); font-family: Courier New; font-size: 11px;">&quot;C:\Program Files\WinMerge\WinMergeU.exe&quot;</span> /e /ub /dl %3 /dr %5 %6 %7</span></p>
A couple immediate advantages is that you now get descriptive labels for the 2 different file windows (working copy, revision), and you can quickly exit out of a diff by pressing ESC, making it easy to cycle through a folder of modified files.

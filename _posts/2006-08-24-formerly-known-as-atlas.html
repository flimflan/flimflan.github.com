  content: Renaming Atlas to ASP.NET 7.0 is as ridiculous as renaming  WinFX to the
    .NET Framework 3.0. And I bet this is exactly your point, isn't it?

    I suppose that Vista''s calculator will be Calc 1342!'

<p>You've probably read the news a hundred times around the blogosphere already, but that won't stop me from joining the chorus and adding my 2 cents.<br /><br />The <a target="_blank" href="http://atlas.asp.net/Default.aspx?tabid=47">Microsoft AJAX (formerly known as DHTML) technology, codename Atlas</a>, will be officially named... ASP.NET 7.0!</p>
<p>I was very skeptical at first... this is the explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;ASP.NET 7.0 aptly identifies the technology for exactly what it is &ndash; the next version of our web developer framework.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...The change is in name only and will not affect the technologies being delivered as part of the product.&nbsp;ASP.NET 7.0&nbsp;is still comprised of the existing ASP.NET 2.0 components, including DataSource controls, the Provider model, and Master Pages &amp; Themes,&nbsp;as well as new web 2.0 developer-focused innovative technologies like UpdatePanels and JSON serialization.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...The ASP.NET platform has always been at the core of Atlas, but the Atlas brand didn&rsquo;t convey this&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...The name conveys the maturity of the platform by emphasizing that it has evolved from proven technology in production for over a decade, while also aligning it with the rest of the Web Tools Platform (IIS 7 + IE 7).&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Over a decade you ask?</em> Follow along - it started with Active Server Pages 1, 2, &amp; 3.0, changed the brand slightly to ASP.NET (4.0), ASP.NET 1.1 (5.0), and then most recently ASP.NET 2.0 (6.0). The next logical name of the development platform, ASP.NET 7.0, more accurately reflects this heritage.</p>
<p>(I can't help but suspect a little marketeering &quot;two-upmanship&quot;&nbsp;over the PHP 5 competition).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In the specific example of ASP.NET 7.0, there is a lot of new compelling improvements to the technology that warrant a major version number for the redist&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...We are confident that this change will go a long way towards reducing confusion people may have about our web developer platform and the technologies in which they should invest.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reducing confusion? Ok, never mind what I said earlier about coming around.. this is ridiculous. If <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2006/06/09/624300.aspx">any of this</a> bugs you like <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jasonz/archive/2006/06/13/630066.aspx">it bugs me</a>, go sign the <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/winfx/petition.html">Reverse WinFX Petition</a>.</p>

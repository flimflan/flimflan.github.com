  content: i have downloaded dasblog 2.0 and in the configuration page it asks for
    Akismet API, which i enterd and saved my Conf setting, but still it is not blocking
    Spam. Is there any other way by which i can use that Aksimet API in dasblog 2.0

<p><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DasBlog19Released.aspx">DasBlog 1.9</a> was recently released and contained many new features worth the upgrade. As a member of the development team, I've been running the nightly builds anyway, so I was surprised to read how much functionality people were missing out on by still running the previous public release.</p> <p>One feature that I've never been satisfied with is the anti-spam support. We've had&nbsp;CAPTCHA support for some time, but it has been finicky, and as a frequent commenter myself, I find it an annoying solution. I've become spoiled by <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a>&nbsp;and its automatic spam filtering of my email, so&nbsp;I expect the same for my blog. When I became aware of <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>, I was sold immediately. Akismet provides automatic spam filtering for blogs: you run comments to your site through their service and they tell you if they're junk. They provide a simple REST web service API to make it easy to integrate with your blog software of choice. <a href="http://haacked.com/">Phil Haack</a> made it even sweeter by <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2006/09/26/Subtext_Akismet_API.aspx">wrapping the Akismet API</a> in a nice C# object model for use in <a href="http://subtextproject.com/">Subtext</a>. By the glory of open source software, I was able to pluck the code out of the Subtext Subversion repository and drop it in the DasBlog repository. A little glue and UI polishing later, and DasBlog now supports intelligent, adapting, and automatic comment moderation.</p> <p>To be clear, Akismet support was added <em>after</em> the 1.9 release. If you download the official release, the Akismet options will not be available.&nbsp;I expect we will put out&nbsp;a 1.9 point release sometime in the next couple months, but can make no guarantees. If you want this feature as much as I did, you can install one of the nightly builds from <a title="http://dasblog.info/dbftp/" href="http://dasblog.info/dbftp/">http://dasblog.info/dbftp/</a>&nbsp;(get 1.9.6276 or later). There has been very few changes since the official release, so I don't think you need&nbsp;be concerned about stability. Go check it out and let me know what you think!</p>

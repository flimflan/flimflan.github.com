<p>Ayende Rahien will be <a href="http://www.ayende.com/Blog/archive/2008/05/06/Course-Building-Domain-Specific-Languages-in-BooCourse-Building-Domain-Specific.aspx" target="_blank">giving a course on buliding DSLs with Boo</a> in Austin on May 19-20. I'm a closet fan of Boo, having lurked on the mailing list for about 6 months, and really looking forward to getting a stronger grasp of the language, and the benefits of building your own domain specific languages. This is a great opportunity to learn from the preeminent creator of Boo DSLs. <p>Scott Bellware sent a good writeup to the AgileATX mailing list: <blockquote> <p>This class takes you deeper into the reasoning and power of dynamic<br>programming on the CLR.&nbsp; It will show you how to build and take<br>advantage of DSL's for your own CLR applications, and why DSL's and<br>language-oriented programming are such a valuable practice at this<br>point on the programming timeline.&nbsp; <br>You'll leave this class having been jump-started on a new, powerful<br>language and paradigm, and be connected to other motivated .NET folks<br>who are working toward bringing some of successes of dynamic<br>programming communities into the .NET community.</p> <p>The class will also give you the opportunity to check out a town that<br>folks are starting to recognize as a progressive and leading .NET<br>competency in North America, and to have some fun with Austin's<br>developer community folks in lush green and sunshine of Central Texas.</p></blockquote> <p>There are still some spots open, if you are interested you can <a href="http://ayende.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">register here</a>.</p>
